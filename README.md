## Step 1
* Implement ncurse display using the ShellDisplay.[cpp/hpp] class
* Implement std container to contain a non finite list of modules to display
* Define a method of selection for type of display to use and how we make this work USING the mandatory interface
* Implement configuration file creation/save "on the fly"

## Step 2
* Define content of each module derived from the interface *i.e. the member functions and abstract methods that NEED defining* **such as update_values(void) maybe?**
* Implement each mandatory module:
  * Hostname.[cpp/hpp]
  * OS.[cpp/hpp]
  * Time.[cpp/hpp]
  * CPU.[cpp/hpp]
  * RAM.[cpp/hpp]
  * Network.[cpp/hpp]

## Step 3
* Define which graphical library to use for the windowed display
* Implement said display in the WindowedDisplay.[cpp/hpp]
* Implement configuration file for this display with creation/save "on the fly"
